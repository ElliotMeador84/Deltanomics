[Alasdair Sykes'](https://www.alasdairsykes.me/) blog is relatively new. It has some great resources on developing clean and efficient workflows in R. Alasdair is also the data scientist doing a lot of the analysis behind the scenes for [Fringe Biscuit](https://www.fringebiscuit.com/), which is itself a blog about Edinbugh's yearly Fringe Festival, and you can find some useful workflows that Alasdair uses over at Fringe Biscuit.
