abstract: Social media is widely becoming a platform for farmers and plant health stakeholders to share and obtain information about plants. This may likely increase in the future as more and more stakeholders become comfortable with using social media as a part of their everyday lives. This research uses data collected plant stakeholders on Twitter based primarily in Scotland between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020. Social network analysis reveals that many stakeholders are actively engaging in discussions around plant health, this includes discussions around new pathogens and best practices in plant health.
